Hacking it yourself
-------------------

Here are some hints when you want to work with the sources from
the FreeHDL CVS repository.

* You need a couple of tools installed to compile this module.  The
  versions should not be critical as FreeHDL does not make use of
  advanced features of the tools.  Just use some reasonably recent
  package.  The indicated versions are known to work.

  - automake     1.7.0
  - autoconf     2.57
  - libtool      1.5
  - bison        1.25
  - flex         2.5.31
  - guile        1.3.1

  The final distribution tarball does not need these tools.

* The repository contains only source files, that is, files that are
  written and maintained by us humans.  Automatically generated files
  are not checked in.  There is some controversy over this, but I
  think for FreeHDL it is easier this way, because we can use slightly
  different versions of the tools above and avoid constantly
  overwriting each others generated files.

  To `prime' a fresh checked out module, run "autogen.sh".  This is a
  little script that will run automake, autoconf, libtool and their
  various helpers.  If you want to return to a clean slate, run
  "cleanit.sh".

  You should not need to rerun autogen.sh when you have changed
  configure.in or Makefile.am, etc.  The Makefile should have rules to
  automatically regenerate all files.

* Please adhere to the GNU Coding Standards.  Keeping detailed
  ChangeLog entries is especially important.  The initial ChangeLog is
  empty, unfortunately, but now that more people are working on the
  sources, please provide ChangeLog entries.  If you are unsure how to
  go about documenting your changes, please contact us.

  I think it's generally a good idea to write ChangeLog entries first
  and then automatically derive the CVS log messages from them.  The
  Emacs program "pcl-cvs" has support for this.

* Please document user visible changes in NEWS.
