Cetus 0.5.1 (November 6, 2007)

Cetus is a source-to-source compiler infrastructure written in Java. We
currently support ANSI C transformation and support for C++ is currently under
development.


FEATURES
---------
Cetus 0.5.1 has the following updated features:

For Users:
* New and improved website interface for our users
* Web-based feedback and bug reporting via Bugzilla
* Cetus mailing lists for better exchange of 
  Cetus-related information

Source-related:
* Cetus is now being regression tested using the 
  SPEC2006 CPU benchmarks and a few related bug-fixes
  have been incorporated in this release.
* Support for C99 datatypes _Bool, _Complex, and
  _Imaginary
* Current interface to symbol table is under revision and
  will be improved for the next release, while still
  supporting the old interface


REQUIREMENTS
-------------
* Java 2 SDK, SE 1.5.0 (or later)    (Required)
* ANTLRv2 2.7.5        (or later)    (Required)
* Bash                               (Required)


INSTALLATION
-------------
* Obtain Cetus distribution
  The latest version of Cetus can be obtained at:
  http://cetus.ecn.purdue.edu/

* Unpack
  Users need to unpack the distribution before installing Cetus.
  $ cd <directory_where_cetus.tar.gz_exists>
  $ gzip -d cetus.tar.gz | tar xvf -

* Build
  The Makefile in the "cetus" directory controls the compilation of Cetus.
  It is important to let Makefile know the location of ANTLR runtime binary.
  $ cd cetus
  $ make antlr=<directory_where_antlr.jar_exists>


LIMITATIONS
------------
The following bugs are currently under review and have not been
fixed for release 0.5.1. The affected SPEC2006 CPU benchmarks
are mentioned for reference.

* Currently, Cetus does not support the passing of variable
  types as parameters to a function call.
  e.g.
  va_arg(temp, int);
  
  The above function is a built-in GCC function that accepts
  variable types as parameters.

  Affected benchmarks: 400.perlbench
                       445.gobmk
                       462.libquantum

* Currently, Cetus does not support the C99 operator
  __alignof__ which accepts a variable type or an expression
  as its operand.

  Affected benchmarks: 403.gcc

* Currently, Cetus does not support the simultaneous usage of 
  ANSI C and K&R C function declaration formats within the 
  same source file.
  e.g.
  void temp_func(int a, int b);
  ....
  ....
  void temp_func()
    int a;
    int b;
  {
  ....
  }

  Affected benchmarks: 456.hmmer (hsregex.c)
